# FTP

## üìí¬†FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- Used to **upload/download files** between client and server.
- Works on **TCP ports 21 (control)** and **20 (data)**.
- Needs **login credentials** (unless it's anonymous FTP).
- FTP sends data in **clear-text** (not secure by default).
- Two modes:
    - **Active Mode**: Server connects back to client (can be blocked by firewalls).
    - **Passive Mode**: Client connects to server (firewall-friendly).
- Can use FTP programs or browser support.
- Commands include file upload, download, delete, and directory operations.
- Server responds with **status codes** (e.g., 200 = success).

## üìÇ TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

- **Simpler** than FTP, used for basic file transfers.
- Works on **UDP**, not TCP (less reliable).
- **No login required**, no password protection.
- Only works in **safe, internal networks** (not for the internet).
- Limited to files with global read/write access.
- **No directory listing** support.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common TFTP Commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `connect` | Set remote host (and port) |
| `get` | Download file(s) from server |
| `put` | Upload file(s) to server |
| `quit` | Exit TFTP |
| `status` | Show current settings |
| `verbose` | Toggle detailed output |

## Default Configuration-vsFTPd(Very Secure FTP Daemon)

- One of the most popular FTP servers on Linux.
- Default config file located at:
üìÅ /etc/vsftpd.conf
- Install command:

```
sudo apt install vsftpd
```

- Used to **configure FTP settings** like login access, anonymous access, logging, etc.
- Some settings are **enabled by default**, others are **commented out**.
- Additional options can be found in the **man page**:

```
man vsftpd.conf
```
