### üîç Identifying Employees & Technologies via Social Media:

- Platforms like **LinkedIn** and **Xing** are valuable for discovering:
    - Employee roles and skills
    - Technologies and frameworks they work with
    - Software used within the organization
    - Current areas of focus (from posts, likes, shares)
- **Employee profiles** may reveal:
    - Programming languages and tools they specialize in
    - Team structure and organization
    - Security focus and certifications

### üìÑ Job Post Analysis:

- Job ads can reveal a **company‚Äôs tech stack**, e.g.:
    - **Languages**: Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl
    - **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
    - **Frameworks**: Flask, Django, ASP.NET, Spring
    - **ORMs**: SQLAlchemy, Hibernate, Entity Framework
    - **Testing**: Pytest, JUnit, xUnit
    - **Tools**: Git, SVN, Mercurial, Perforce
    - **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools
    - **Security**: CompTIA Security+, software security best practices
    - **Other**: Atlassian suite (Jira, Confluence), Redis, NumPy

### üß† Inferred Insights:

- Job listings and employee profiles often suggest:
    - Development methodologies (e.g., Agile, CI/CD)
    - Type of architecture (e.g., microservices, RESTful APIs)
    - Possible **open-source resources or internal misconfigurations**

### üîó Open Source Threat Surface:

- **Github projects** from employees may include:
    - Hardcoded sensitive data (e.g., JWT tokens, emails)
    - Misconfigurations (especially if projects follow insecure templates)
    - Real-world usage of frameworks like Django (linked to OWASP Top 10 risks)

### üéØ Targeting Strategy:

- Focus on **technical employees in development and security** roles to:
    - Understand infrastructure and threat landscape
    - Predict security posture and potential gaps
- Use advanced search filters on LinkedIn for precise targeting (role, company, tools, location)
