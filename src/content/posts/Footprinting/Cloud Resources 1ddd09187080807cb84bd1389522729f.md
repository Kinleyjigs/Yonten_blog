# Cloud Resources

## 🌍 **Why Cloud Is Important**

- Most companies use **cloud services** like:
    - **AWS (Amazon)**
    - **GCP (Google Cloud)**
    - **Azure (Microsoft)**
- These platforms allow **remote work** and **central management**.

## ⚠️ **Common Misconfigurations**

- Cloud providers secure the base infrastructure.
- But **bad configurations** by admins can expose:
    - **S3 buckets** (AWS)
    - **Blob storage** (Azure)
    - **Cloud Storage** (GCP)
- These may be **publicly accessible** if not secured properly.

## 🔎 **Example – Company Hosted on AWS**

- During a scan, we found:

<aside>
💡

- **s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250**
</aside>

- Indicates an **S3 bucket** used by the company.

## 🧭 **Why DNS Matters**

- Admins often **add cloud resources** (like S3) to DNS for easier access.
- This can **leak information** if DNS records are exposed.

## 🌐 **How to Find Cloud Resources**

### Google Search for AWS

- Use **Google Dorks** to search public cloud files:
    
    ```
    inurl:s3.amazonaws.com intext:companyname
    ```
    
- Dorks help find **public cloud links** containing sensitive company info.

### Google Search for Azure

```
intext:companyname inurl:blob.core.window.net
```

### Domain.Glass Results

- Reveals information about a domain’s **registrant, subdomains, and infrastructure**.
- Can indicate if a company uses **Cloudflare**, and what the **security level** is (e.g., “Safe”).
