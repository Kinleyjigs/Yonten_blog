# Windows Remote Management

- **Remote Management** lets you control Windows servers from another machine.
- Enabled by default since **Windows Server 2016**.
- Based on **WS-Management protocol**, supports local and remote management.
- Tools include:
    - **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)**
    - **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)**
    - **RDP (Remote Desktop Protoc**

### üñ•Ô∏è **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

- Microsoft protocol to remotely access Windows GUI.
- Uses **TCP/UDP port 3389**.
- Works at the **Application Layer** of the TCP/IP model.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security**

- Uses **TLS/SSL encryption** (from Windows Vista onwards).
- Weak point: Default certificates are **self-signed**, can be faked.
- **NLA (Network Level Authentication)** is recommended for safer connections.

### üåê **Connectivity**

- Both local and network firewalls must allow RDP.
- If behind **NAT**, set up **port forwarding** and use the public IP.

### üïµÔ∏è **Footprinting RDP Services (Recon)**

- **Nmap** can scan and reveal:
    - If **NLA** is enabled
    - Server **hostname**, **domain**, **version**

Example Nmap command:

```markdown
nmap -sV -sC -p3389 --script rdp* <target-ip>
```

### üïµÔ∏è **Advanced Scanning with Packet Tracing**

```markdown
nmap -sV -sC -p3389 --packet-trace rdp* <target-ip>
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

- Tools and packet traces can be **detected by EDR** (Endpoint Detection & Response).
- May result in **blocking** during penetration tests on secure networks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Tip**

- RDP is powerful but also risky if misconfigured.
- Use **strong encryption**, **valid certificates**, and **NLA** to stay secure.
- Monitor for scanning patterns (like Nmap probes) as they may indicate recon.
