# ðŸ‘¾Â Enumeration

- Main Goal: Find all possible ways to attack a target system not just gain access.
- Not Just Tools: Tools help, but knowing how to use them and what to look for is more important.
- Understand Services: Learn how different services work and how to communicate with them.
- Collect Info: The more information we gather, the easier it is to find weak points.
- Two Key Things to Look For:
    - Services or functions that allow interaction or give extra info.
    - Info that leads to more useful info.
- Misconfigurations Help: Most useful info comes from weak setups or poor security.
- Manual Skills Matter: Tools can't always bypass security â€” manual checks are important.
- Why People Get Stuck: Itâ€™s usually due to lack of understanding of the service, not the tools.
- Invest Time Wisely: Learning how a service works can save you hours or days later.
- Scanning Tools Have Limits:
    - Tools may mark ports as closed if slow to respond.
    - These ports might still be useful â€” donâ€™t ignore them.

**Example:**

- Vague info = slow progress.
- Detailed info = fast success.
